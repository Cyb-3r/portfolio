# Introduction

Here is my portfolio, this is where you will get to know a bit more about me, my skills and goal.
It features a responsive and simple design, so if you want to check on my portfolio on the go, I've got you.

The whole thing is written in pure html, css, and javascript.

## changelog

For the while, it's complete enough to be online, but there are still some things missing such as the links to my projects. They will eventually be added as I update my portfolio.
